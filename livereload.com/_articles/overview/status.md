(As of September 2016.)

I've made numerous unsuccessful attempts to rebuild LiveReload from scratch, calling it LiveReload 3. This project has suffered from a lot of things, including my burnout and a “second project syndrome”.

I've since abandoned this approach and now working on incremental updates to LiveReload 2. I'm not yet sure if I'll release it as version 2.x or version 3.0, but we're finally moving somewhere.

Despite how it may occasionally look, LiveReload is not abandoned, and I'm interested in further development.
