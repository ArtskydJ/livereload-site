(As of October 2014.)

## Version 3.x

I've been working on version 3.0, the next major cross-platform release, since summer 2012\. It will be a free upgrade, but I have no release date to announce.

## Version 2.x on the Mac

In maintenance mode. Generally works pretty well, including on Yosemite.

## Support

Support is on hiatus in September and October 2014. Planned to be resumed by the end of October.
