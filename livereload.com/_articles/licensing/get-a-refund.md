If you are not happy with your purchase, we will provide a refund at any time.

## Try a beta

Before or after getting the refund, please be sure to [tell us about your problems](mailto:support@livereload.com) so that we can fix them for everyone else. Also try [the latest beta version](http://go.livereload.com/beta) if you haven't already — the problem might be fixed there.

## Getting a refund for Mac App Store purchases

Apple does not provide any refund controls to the developers, so we cannot refund your Mac App Store purchase directly. You can either request a refund from Apple (procedure described below) or ask us to send your money back directly.

If you have a PayPal account, the easiest solution for you is to email [support@livereload.com](mailto:support@livereload.com) and provide your PayPal account email address. Please also tell us the amount you've paid — normally that's $9.99, but could be less if LiveReload was on sale. (Note that we lose Apple's 30% cut plus local taxes in this transaction. That's fine because we only get a couple of refund requests per month. If we screw up badly and a lot of people apply for a refund, we might ask you to try the Apple route first.)

Alternatively, you can request a refund from Apple — fill in the [Mac App Store customer service request form](http://www.apple.com/support/mac/app-store/contact.html?form=account&amp;topic=Mac%20App%20Store%20Account%20and%20Billing) and pick “This app didn't function as expected”:

Note that Apple does not officially support refunds; they do issue them regularly, but theoretically this is on a case-by-case basis.

If Apple does not want to help you and you don't have a PayPal account, we can work out something else (like an iTunes gift card if you're in US).

Please email [support@livereload.com](mailto:support@livereload.com) in any case — we'd love to know about the problems you have.
