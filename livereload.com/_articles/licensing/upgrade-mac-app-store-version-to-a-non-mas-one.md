Yes.

**Here's how it works:**

1\. You run the Mac App Store version at least once.

2\. It stores the license file in your Library folder.

3\. Non-MAS version sees the license file and knows that it's fully licensed.

**Why would I want to upgrade?**

Non-MAS versions can be released without Apple approval process, so if you're working with leading-edge technologies, you might enjoy getting the updates faster.

**Can I go back?**

Yes. You can delete LiveReload and reinstall it from the Mac App Store at any time.

**Troubleshooting:**

Please contact support if LiveReload does not recognize your MAS license.
