## Volume Licensing

Volume licensing is currently suspended. Please purchase a site license for your company.

{% comment %}
If you need 5 or more licenses for your company, you can purchase LiveReload via PayPal. Here's the deal:

*   $10 per license (5–30 licenses)

*   **the licenses are transferrable between employees** (“per-seat”)
*   free email support over the course of the product lifetime
*   includes any other platform versions we will release (e.g. a Windows version when it is released)
{% endcomment %}

## Site License

Unlimited usage license within a single company:

* $500 for companies with 10 developers or more (regardless of whether the developers are currently going to use LiveReload), $100 for companies with under 10 developers
* unlimited use within a single company
* payable via PayPal or credit card
* invoice with a purchase order number if needed
* single license key unlocks the product for everyone
* includes any other platform versions we will release (e.g. a Windows version when it is released).

Note: if we introduce cloud-based subscription features in the future (in addition to the currently available functionality), those will _not_ be included in your purchase.


## Enterprise License

If you need an enterprise-friendly purchasing process or additional training. Key features:

* $2000
* unlimited use within a single company _and any outside contractors_
* includes one-hour screen sharing / Skype session with Andrey Tarantsov to help you get the most value out of LiveReload
* a custom license agreement if you need one
* invoice with a purchase order number
* we'll be happy to deal with your accounting dept to receive the payment through your usual means
* free updates over the product lifetime


## Custom Build

* $5000
* a custom branded build that doesn't require entering the license code
* includes everything an enterprise license provides
* optionally disable built-in updater and have your IT dept manage updates
* optionally disable any interactions with outside servers
* optionally limit access to any other features (e.g. plugins)
* other customizations negotiable (might cost extra for larger changes)
* any customizations preserved and maintained for the next 5 years across product updates
