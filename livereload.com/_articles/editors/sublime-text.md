See my screencast: [Sublime Text Workflow That Beats Coda and Espresso](http://tarantsov.com/blog/2012/02/sublime-text-workflow-that-beats-coda-and-espresso/).

Other important notes:

*   There's a ‘livereload’ Sublime Text 2 plugin. It is not affiliated with LiveReload, and is in fact incompatible with LiveReload 2.
*   Sublime Text 2 is one of our main targets, we plan a lot of features here. [Be sure to vote!](http://go.livereload.com/votebox)
