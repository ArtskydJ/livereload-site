Supported features:

*   jumping to a compilation error location;

*   live reloading in Coda live preview window (if you use the SCRIPT tag integration method â€” see: {% ref browser: How do I choose the best integration method? %})

Installation:

*   none, should work out of the box.

Caveats:

*   Go To Line is implemented by emulating key presses (e.g. Command-Shift-L, 4, 2, Enter), which occasionally might go wrong. Sorry, Panic support says there is no better way.
