  LiveReload 2 has a very simple goal: to take away the pains of web development. It
  packs a lot of tiny features to make that happen:

*   it works with mobile devices and their simulators (if you use [our JavaScript snippet](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86180-how-do-i-add-the-script-tag-manually-)); Adobe Shadow team has even [featured Shadow+LiveReload workflow](http://blogs.adobe.com/shadow/2012/04/24/shadow-livereload-workflow/) on their blog, and then posted
      [this awesome video demo](http://blogs.adobe.com/cantrell/archives/2012/05/a-complete-tour-of-adobe-shadow-in-10-minutes-including-integration-with-livereload.html)

*   it works with virtually every web language and framework, supporting complex stuff
      like CSS @imports; v2.3.9+ adds support for the popular prefix-free JS library

*   it provides a smooth workflow when your site is running on a remote server [if you use one of the supported approaches](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86183-overview-of-remote-workflows); it even has a simple
      built-in web server to serve modified CSS files without waiting for them to get
      uploaded, as part of the URL override feature

*   you can even [preview your CSS changes against a live site without uploading
      anything](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86220-preview-css-changes-against-a-live-site-then-uplo)
