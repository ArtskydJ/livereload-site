(As of July 2014.)

## Version 3.x

I've been working on version 3.0, the next major cross-platform release, since summer 2012\. It will be a free upgrade, but I have no release date to announce.

## Version 2.x on the Mac

In maintenance mode. Generally works pretty well.

## Support

Support tickets are being replied on time since August 2013\. From May 2014, I generally have a one-day response time on all tickets (yay, my life's getting back in order!)

I had periods when I haven't been attending to support requests from ~November 2012 to ~July 2013\. If this has affected you, I'm very sorry; yes, I am. I have 770 unanswered tickets from that period. When I actually became capable of replying, several months have passed by, and it would be very funny to send a response at that point.

I have improved my support process a lot, and generally resolved the problems that I had.
