## <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; ">Compatible:</span>

*   any Macs running OS X 10.7 or 10.8 (Lion or Mountain Lion)
*   64-bit Macs running OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard (the ones that are upgradable to 10.7)Not compatible:

*   32-bit Macs running OS X 10.6 (the ones that are not supported by 10.7; to the best
  of my knowledge, those only include pre-Core 2 Duo MacBooks, although might also
  include some early Minis) â€” [there's a very old build that works on 32-bit Macs](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86274-32-bit-mac-support)
*   the ones limited to OS X 10.5 and any prior OSes
