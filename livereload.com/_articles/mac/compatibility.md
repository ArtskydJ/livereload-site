Compatible:

* any Macs running OS X 10.7 (Lion), 10.8 (Mountain Lion), 10.9 (Mavericks) or 10.10 (Yosemite)
* 64-bit Macs running OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard (the ones that are upgradable to 10.7)

Not compatible:

* 32-bit Macs running OS X 10.6 (the ones that are not supported by 10.7; to the best
  of my knowledge, those only include pre-Core 2 Duo MacBooks, although might also
  include some early Minis) â€” [there's a very old build that works on 32-bit Macs](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86274-32-bit-mac-support)
* the ones limited to OS X 10.5 and any prior OSes
