If you came looking for a specific article or discussion, it does not exist any more. There are redirects for many of them, but looks like yours isn't among that happy bunch.

Bummer.

Or is it?

Ultimately, this is great news for you.&nbsp;The new site powered by UserVoice allows for safer discussions, less spam, richer knowledge base articles and has public feature voting.

For now, though, please drop us a line&nbsp;via the “Contact support” link in the sidebar or by email at&nbsp;[support@livereload.com](mailto:support@livereload.com)&nbsp;(or using the live chat widget that you can only see when we're around), and we'll be happy to answer any questions you currently have.

And [here's our public votebox](http://go.livereload.com/votebox). It certainly feels lonely without your&nbsp;ideas and suggestions.
