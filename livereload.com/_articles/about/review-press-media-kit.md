Please provide a link to your review when you publish it. I will post the link to LiveReload's Twitter account.

## Promo codes giveaway

You can get 5-10 promo codes to give away (if you do that kind of stuff). A few ideas:

*   publish them on the product review page to reward your loyal readers, or

*   post them to your Twitter account over a few days to increase your following, or

*   send them to your email subscribers over the next several issues to increase engagement.

Gotchas:

*   Subject to availability â€” I only get 50 promo codes from Apple per each released version.

*   The codes expire every few weeks, so it's best to postpone generating the codes until you actually need them. Please contact me to reserve the codes in advance, though.

*   Each code can only be used once.

Promo codes are to be redeemed on the Mac App Store using a 'Redeem' link under Quick Links.
