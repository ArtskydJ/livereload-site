<p>The latest versions of LiveReload do not support 32-bit Macs. As a rule of thumb, if you cannot install Lion, you also cannot run the latest LiveReload.</p>

<p><strong>However,</strong> by a popular demand, we've been able to build an older version (2.0Î±6) for 32-bit architecture.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox have changed the web socket protocol, and the 32-bit version cannot talk to them.</p><p>The options you have are:</p><p></p><ul><li>using Safari, which should work<br></li><li>using an older version of Firefox (or Chrome)</li></ul><p></p><p></p>

<p>(I will try to look into porting a newer version of LiveReload to 32-bit Macs when I have a moment.)</p><p>Before I give you the download link, here are some usage terms:<br></p>

<ul>
<li>You are only allowed to run this on 32-bit machines. When you upgrade, please buy the latest version. (Nothing will prevent you from running it technically, though. And the kill date is disabled too.)</li>
<li>Node.js-based compilers (LESS, Stylus, Jade, CoffeeScript, Eco) won't work, because the bundled version of Node.js is 64-bit; however, if you replace 'Resources/node' executable within the app bundle with an appropriate 32-bit version, it has a good chance of working.<br></li>
<li>We officially wish you a new Mac for Christmas (and every other holiday after that).</li>
</ul>
