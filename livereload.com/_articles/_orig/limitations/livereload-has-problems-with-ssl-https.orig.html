<p>LiveReload works by injecting livereload.js script into your web pages. The script has a URL like http://localhost:35729/livereload.js; on https pages that triggers an “insecure content warning” or a similar message from your browser.</p><p></p><p><b>Workaround:</b> You should be able to configure your browser to suppress the warnings. Google for your browser name and “mixed mode warnings” (or the exact error message).</p><p><b>Vote to fix this problem</b> on <a href="http://feedback.livereload.com/forums/157942-general/suggestions/2988007-fix-livereload-to-work-with-https">its feedback entry here</a>&nbsp;— non-anonymous voters get subscribed to the updates.</p><p><b>Status:</b> I'm planning to look into it some time soon, but for now, please consider this a limitation.</p><p>(The main problem is that&nbsp;livereload.js can be accessed via multiple domain names, and even when it's on localhost, there's no way to obtain a trusted SSL certificate for localhost. I do have a few options in mind, though.)</p><p></p>
