<p>If your HAML chokes on Unicode characters (within or outside LiveReload), you might want to add the following line to the top of your Unicode files:</p><pre>-# coding: utf-8</pre><p>This should only happen when using Ruby 1.9 configured through Compilation Options. <a href="http://haml.info/docs/yardoc/file.HAML_REFERENCE.html#encodings">The line is documented here</a>.</p><p>This problems seems to occur for some people but not others. In particular, it does not occur for me, so I don't really understand what happens here. If you can shed some light on it, please give me a note!</p>
