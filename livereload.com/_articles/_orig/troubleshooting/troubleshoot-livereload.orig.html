Please watch out for these common problems:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Cannot find the app on a Mac? By default it lives in your menu bar on 10.7 and in
your dock on 10.6.
</li>
<li>Using prefixfree JavaScript library (e.g. as part of HTML5 boilerplate)? Please
<a href="http://go.livereload.com/intro">upgrade to the
latest beta version</a>.
</li><li>Using a proxy server? Be sure to configure 127.0.0.1 to bypass the proxy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some common problems with browser extensions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure you've activated the extension by clicking its toolbar button on the desired page.</li>

<li>Chrome and Safari extensions can only access pages loaded after the extension installation/update. Try reopening your tabs or restarting the browser if you have a problem with extensions.<br></li>

<li>Safari extension does not have access to file: URLs. There is no way around it; the best solution is to use Chrome.</li>
</ul>
