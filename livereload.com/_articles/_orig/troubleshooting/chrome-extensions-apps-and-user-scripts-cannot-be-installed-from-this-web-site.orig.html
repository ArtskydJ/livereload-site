<p>Google Chrome 21 no longer installs off-store extensions by default (see <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=128748">issue 128748 in Chromium</a>). To install an extension outside of Chrome Web Store, you now need to:</p><p></p><ul><li>manually download the file (right click → Save As…)</li><li>open the Extensions page in Chrome (Window → Extensions)</li><li>drag the downloaded .crx file into the Extensions page<br></li></ul><p>A user reports that launching Chrome with&nbsp;<code>--enable-easy-off-store-extension-install</code> option will restore the old functionality so that no drag and drop is needed.</p><p>We are considering whether LiveReload extension should return to the Chrome Web Store. Let us know what you think.</p>
