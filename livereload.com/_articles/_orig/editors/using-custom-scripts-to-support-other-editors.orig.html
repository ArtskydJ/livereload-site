<p>If your favorite editor is not supported by LiveReload, and you know how to make it open a specific file (on a specific line) from the command line, you can easily support it by writing a shell script and saving it as <code>~/.livereload/edit</code>.</p>

<p>The first (required) command-line argument will be the file name. The second (optional) argument is the line number. The second argument will be omitted in certain cases.</p>

<p>You can put <code>LR-editor-name: "SomeName"</code> anywhere in your script (presumably in a comment) to specify the name LiveReload should use in the UI to refer to this editor.</p>

<p>Here's an example script to support TextMate:</p>

<pre><code>#! /bin/bash
# LR-editor-name: "MyMate"
open "txmt://open/?url=file://$1&amp;line=$2"
</code></pre>

<p>If you made a useful script, we encourage you to send it to support@livereload.com so that we can add native support for that editor in the next release.</p>

<p>Don't forget to make your script executable (<code>chmod +x ~/.livereload/edit</code>).</p>
