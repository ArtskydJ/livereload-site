<p>(This article is about output paths of compilers like SASS and CoffeeScript. If you're not using compilation feature of LiveReload, it does not apply to you.)</p>

<p>When you add an existing project to LiveReload, it tries to be smart about auto-detecting your existing output path rules. Namely, in version 2.3.7+, the rules are as follows (with .less and .css as examples of a source and output extensions):</p>

<ul>
<li>for a file foo/bar/boz.less, if there's boz.css in the same folder, it is used</li>
<li>otherwise, if there's exactly one “unclaimed” boz.css anywhere else in the project, it is used (“unclaimed” means that no other .less file has that boz.css set as its output path)</li>
<li>otherwise, if boz.less's parent folder has one of the predefined names (like “css”, “styles”, “stylesheets” — the actual names depend on the compiler), boz.css is created in that directory</li>
<li>otherwise, if one of boz.less's ancestor folders has a subfolder with one of the predefined names (like “css”, “styles”, “stylesheets”), boz.css is created in that subfolder</li>
<li>otherwise, boz.css is created in the same folder as boz.less</li>
</ul>
