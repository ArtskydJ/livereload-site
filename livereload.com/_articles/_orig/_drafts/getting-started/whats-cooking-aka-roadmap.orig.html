<p>I'm working on 2.4 and 3.0 versions of LiveReload now.<br></p><p>Version 2.4 is the next regular update. Trying to add some oft-requested functionality in.</p><p>Version 3.0 is a complete cross-platform rewrite of the app.<br></p><p>I plan to add the following features over time:</p><p></p><ul><li>IE support in livereload.js (no IE browser extension planned so far), plus a better coverage of Android browsers</li><li>fully-functional Windows version</li><li>production workflow: minification, concatenation, uploading compiled/minified files via (S)FTP</li><li>live reloading as you type (without saving; most likely will be limited to Sublime Text)</li><li>saving CSS changes from Web Inspector and/or Firebug back into CSS files (not sure if I can get that to work with preprocessors like LESS)</li></ul><p></p>
