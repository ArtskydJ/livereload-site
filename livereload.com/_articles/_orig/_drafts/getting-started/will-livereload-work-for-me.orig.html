<p>To successfully use LiveReload, you need:</p><p></p><ul><li>a supported PC or Mac</li><li>a suitable web development workflow</li><li>a supported kind of project</li></ul><p>The best way to find it out is to try a trial version. See: “How do I start using LiveReload?”</p><h2>Supported Macs</h2><p>To run LiveReload on your Mac, you need Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, 10.7 Lion or a 64-bit 10.6 Snow Leopard. (If you are on 10.6, the 64-bit Macs are the ones compatible with Lion. Pre-Core 2 Macs, the ones that are&nbsp;32-bit only and incompatible with Lion, cannot run LiveReload either.)</p><h2>Supported Windows PCs</h2><p>To run LiveReload on your Windows PC, you need to have Windows XP SP3+, Vista or Windows 7.</p><h2>Supported web development workflows</h2><p>If your web site is running locally, you are fine.</p><p>If your web site is running on another server, it depends on the way you edit your files. TODO: more info.</p><h2>Supported types of projects</h2><p>With the latest version (2.3.12), there are no <i>known</i> incompatible projects. However:<br></p><p></p><ul><li>certain (unknown as of yet) JavaScript libraries might break live CSS/image reloading, in which case you'll be able to switch to full page reload mode</li><li>remote server workflows relying on URL overriding function do not work for some of the customers, for a reason that we don't yet know</li></ul>Everything else should be fine. Please be sure to contact support in case you have difficulties!<p></p><p></p>
