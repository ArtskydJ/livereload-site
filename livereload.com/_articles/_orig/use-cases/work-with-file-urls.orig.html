<p>LiveReload is cool with file: URLs, unless you're using a Safari browser extension, which does not allow that. (See: <a href="http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/87979-how-do-i-choose-the-best-integration-method-">How do I choose the best integration method?</a>)</p>


<p>We recommend Chrome over Safari for file: URLs. If, however, you prefer to develop in Safari with a browser extension, we recommend one of these approaches:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>save your files as e.g. <code>~/Sites/something/foo.html</code>, and view it as <code>http://localhost/~username/something/foo.html</code>, where username is your short user name (don't forget to also enable Web Sharing in System Preferences)</p></li>
<li><p>put a symlink into Sites folder to your project directory (you need to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3775102/creating-a-symbolic-link-in-sites-directory">enable symlinks first as described here</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>use <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html">MAMP</a></p></li>
<li><p>use <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-macosx.html">XAMP</a></p></li>
</ul>
