<p>Please configure LiveReload 2 as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>To have LiveReload wait for the upload to finish before reloading the page, enable “Wait X seconds before doing a full page reload”, with X slightly more than your usual upload time (I use 1.5 seconds).</p></li>
<li><p>Waiting sucks when you are editing CSS, though. This is where “Override URLs to serve modified CSS from localhost” comes into play. LiveReload will do some magic to show you the changes instantly on save.</p></li>
<li><p>If the magic runs dry, i.e. this experimental new “CSS override” mode does not work for you, be sure to open a support ticket. But then you can disable both of the above options, and enable the catch-all “Wait X seconds before processing any changes”. It will of course mean that you'll have to wait for every CSS change to upload before you can see it.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>SASS/LESS/CoffeeScript/etc will work out of the box with this scenario.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://go.livereload.com/remote" target="_blank">an overview of other remote workflows</a>.</p>
