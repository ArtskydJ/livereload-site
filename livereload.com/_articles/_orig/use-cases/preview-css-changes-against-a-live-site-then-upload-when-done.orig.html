<p>If most of the work you do is tweaking styles, you can preview your changes against a live site and only upload them when done:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have an up-to-date local copy of the CSS (SASS, LESS, etc) files you want to edit.</li>
<li>Add the local folder to LiveReload and enable URL overriding (“Override URLs to serve modified CSS from localhost”) in Monitoring Options.</li>
<li>Install the LiveReload browser extension if not already installed.</li>
<li>Go to the live site and turn LiveReload on by clicking the toolbar button.</li>
<li>Change a CSS file locally and watch it being applied to your site.</li>
<li>When satisfied, actually upload the new CSS.</li>
</ol>


<p>Limitations:</p>

<ul>
<li>unlike in CSSEdit, you have to save the file to apply the new styles to the browser; in the future we are going to provide some editor plugins to handle this without saving, at least in Sublime Text 2</li>
<li>each time you reload the browser page, you need to save the modified CSS files again to trigger override</li>
<li>identically-named files in different folders will probably confuse LiveReload</li>
</ul>


<p>The last two limitations will be fixed in one of the upcoming updates.</p>
