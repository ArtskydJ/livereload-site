<p>LiveReload works with iOS devices out of the box if you add a correct SCRIPT tag (there are no browser extensions on mobile devices).</p><p></p><p>When your site is running <b>on your local computer</b> (i.e. on the same one that runs LiveReload app), the default script tag is fine.</p><p>When your site is running <b>on another server</b>&nbsp;(or if you're not sure which one is the case), you need to explicitly specify the IP of your local computer:</p><pre>&lt;script src="http://192.168.0.1:35729/livereload.js?snipver=1"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre><p></p><p><b>You should be all set now! </b>Open your site on iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad or on iOS Simulator, and live reloading should work just like it does in desktop browsers.</p><p>Adobe Shadow team has <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/shadow/2012/04/24/shadow-livereload-workflow/">a great walk-through on their blog</a>.</p><p><b>Android support?</b> It's coming soon.</p>
