<p><b>First things first:</b> LiveReload downloaded from the Mac App Store will never say it's a trial version. If the version published on the Mac App Store suits your needs, just delete the app you have and re-download it from the Mac App Store.</p><p><b>Still here? OK, second:</b> LiveReload downloaded from our site&nbsp;<i>should</i> recognize your Mac App Store license and run without the ‘free trial’ message.</p><p>There's a catch, however:&nbsp;<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; ">you must have installed and launched LiveReload 2.2+ from the Mac App Store on that computer at least once</span>.</p><blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"><p>Why? Apple does not provide any APIs to check for existence of the Mac App Store license from an external app; they only store the license file inside the apps downloaded from the Mac App Store. So we do a trick: Mac App Store versions of LiveReload, starting with version 2.2, stash away that file into a Library folder on your computer. When you later launch a non-Mac App Store version of LiveReload, it can find that file and verify the license.</p></blockquote><p>So here's how you fix the problem:</p><p></p><ol><li>Delete LiveReload app.</li><li>Install the latest version from Mac App Store.</li><li>Run it once (it will save the license file into a proper location), then quit.</li><li>Download and install <a href="http://go.livereload.com/mac">the latest version from our site</a>.<br></li></ol><p></p><p><b>If that does not help,</b> please contact support and we'll help you sort it out.</p>
