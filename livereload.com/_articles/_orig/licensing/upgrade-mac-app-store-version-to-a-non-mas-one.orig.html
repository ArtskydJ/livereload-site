<p>Yes.</p><p><b>Here's how it works:</b></p><p></p><p>1. You run the Mac App Store version at least once.</p><p>2. It stores the license file in your Library folder.</p><p>3. Non-MAS version sees the license file and knows that it's fully licensed.<br></p><p><b>Why would I want to upgrade?</b></p><p>Non-MAS versions can be released without Apple approval process, so if you're working with leading-edge technologies, you might enjoy getting the updates faster.</p><p><b>Can I go back?</b></p><p>Yes. You can delete LiveReload and reinstall it from the Mac App Store at any time.</p><p><b>Troubleshooting:</b></p><p>Please contact support if LiveReload does not recognize your MAS license.</p><p></p>
