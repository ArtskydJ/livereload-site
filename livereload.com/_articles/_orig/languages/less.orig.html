<p>There are two ways to use LESS:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can compile LESS into CSS inside the browser.</li>
<li>You can compile LESS into CSS and serve compiled CSS to the browser.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Compiling LESS inside the browser</h2>

<p>This is probably the easiest mode to get started. To compile LESS into CSS directly inside the browser, use code like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet/less" href="mystyles.less"&gt;
&lt;script src="http://lesscss.googlecode.com/files/less-1.1.3.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For live reloading, you have two options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>LESS.js has LiveReload-like mode built in (actually, more live.js-like than LiveReload-like, but I digress): if you append <code>#!watch</code> to the URL, LESS will be reloading all stylesheets every 1.5 seconds</p></li>
<li><p>or you can use the real LiveReload app, which will reload stylesheets immediately on change without waiting for 1.5 seconds (and also reload images, and maybe do more useful stuff).</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Compiling LESS ahead of time</h2>

<p>LiveReload can compile LESS for you (if you enable it in project settings), or your web framework may be compiling LESS for you, or you can run <code>lessc</code> manually.</p>
