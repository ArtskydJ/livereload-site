<h2>Default choice: SASS / Compass</h2>

<p>If you are not using any preprocessors at the moment, we recommend you take a look at <a href="http://compass-style.org/" target="_blank">Compass</a>, which is a framework on top of <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">SASS</a>.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>SASS aims to be a reasonably conservative, designer-friendly language</li>
<li>Compass is a higher-level library of mixins, with some common CSS helpers like <a href="http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/reset/" target="_blank">reset</a>, <a href="http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/layout/" target="_blank">layout elements</a>, <a href="http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/typography/" target="_blank">typography</a>, <a href="http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/css3/" target="_blank">dealing with CSS3</a>, <a href="http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/utilities/" target="_blank">image sprites etc</a> built-in, and a choice of third-party plugins for:

<ul>
<li>grid systems</li>
<li>CSS frameworks like Twitter Bootstrap or ZURB foundation</li>
<li>all kinds of utility stuff</li>
<li>…check out the <a href="https://rubygems.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=compass" target="_blank">huge list of Compass plugin gems</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Not a good choice when:</p>

<ul>
<li>you're looking for (even more) advanced metaprogramming in your stylesheets</li>
<li>you're a syntax junkie like me</li>
</ul>


<p>Getting started:</p>

<li>still looking for a great tutorial to mention here</li>

<h2>Want something simple? Take LESS</h2>

<p><a href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank">LESS</a> helps to simplify your stylesheets, but intentionally does not try to be a programming language. As a result, it is very simple, but it wouldn't be easy to build something like Compass around it — which is why there isn't any.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>another popular choice; LESS is what most people have originally started with</li>
<li>there isn't much to learn; read the home page and you're now a certified less expert</li>
<li>stylish top to bottom — a signature creation of @cloudhead</li>
<li>there is an option of in-browser compilation —&nbsp;not like you'd need it with LiveReload, though, but worth mentioning</li>
</ul>


<p>Not a good choice when:</p>

<ul>
<li>you're looking for more high-level things than merely making your stylesheet easier to write — if you want someone else to handle browser incompatibilities for you then, again, Compass should be your default choice</li>
<li>you're looking for some more advanced automation of your repetitive CSS work</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hacker at heart? Consider Stylus</h2>

<p><a href="http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/" target="_blank">Stylus</a> is made by TJ Holowaychuk, also known as github.com/visionmedia. If you recognize him by the name, or simply love to be meta, try Stylus. It allows infinite possibilities of metaprogramming and has a very lean syntax.</p>

<p>Your only choice if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you routinely kill for a better-looking syntax</li>
<li>the idea of prefixing variable names with funny characters gives you shrinks</li>
<li>you want to redefine standard CSS properties like font-size to transparently do something else</li>
<li>you'd like to invent your own CSS selectors and make them look just like any other CSS selector, and then provide a hideous implementation</li>
<li>you want to transparently recompute all your px-based sizes into %-based sizes in your CSS, without making it look any different (you'd have to code this yourself, though — took me several hours)</li>
</ul>


<p>Not a good choice if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you take practical and clear over smart any time</li>
<li>you want a choice of community-provided plugins — so far, Stylus community does not seem to be booming despite the huge flexibility of this language</li>
</ul>


<p>Stylus has <a href="http://visionmedia.github.com/nib/" target="_blank">Nib</a>, which aims to be a rough equivalent of Compass — minus those hundreds of plugins, plus a super-clean unobtrusive syntax. It <em>could</em> evolve to be the recommended choice for everyone, but so far, the community support is not there.</p>
