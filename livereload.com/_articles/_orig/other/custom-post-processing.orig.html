<p>You can run an arbitrary Terminal command each time LR detects changes (right after any applicable compilers are invoked).</p>

<p>The command is executed via <code>/bin/sh -c "your command"</code>, so anything you can type in Terminal works here too.</p>

<p>Example commands:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>rake</code></li>
<li><code>rake something</code></li>
<li><code>./my-script</code></li>
<li><code>echo $(date) &gt;&gt;log</code> (useless, just to illustrate the idea about sh -c being used)</li>
<li><code>cat js/*.js &gt; js/concat.js</code> (such stuff is best put into a script, though)</li>
</ul>


<p>The output is not displayed anywhere, so use command-line growlnotify yourself if you want it (and/or redirect output to a file). (You can still see the output using Console.app, among other LiveReload logging.)</p>

<h2>Grace period</h2>

<p>Changes made by the post-processing command won't cause processing to run again to avoid an endless loop.</p>

<p>Because the changes may be reported with a certain delay, there's a grace period of 0.5 seconds after the post-processing command finishes. Changes made during this grace period are considered to be potentially made by the post-processing command, and won't cause processing to run again either.</p>

<p>The grace period can be customized in the post-processing options dialog. It cannot be set to less than 0.01 seconds.</p>

<h2>Substitutions</h2>

<p>In the command, you can use the following substitutions (which are expanded before the command is fed into shell):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>$(ruby)</code> — path to system Ruby interpreter</li>
<li><code>$(node)</code> — path to Node interpreter bundled with LiveReload</li>
<li><code>$(project_dir)</code> — path to the project directory (which won't be of use to you, since it will be the current directory when script runs)</li>
</ul>


<p>These substitutions probably aren't of much use at the moment. May get more useful when we get to releasing plugin API.</p>
