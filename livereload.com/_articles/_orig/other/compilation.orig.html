<p>LiveReload can compile LESS, SASS, Compass, CoffeeScript, Jade and others into corresponding css/js/html files.</p>

<p>The following compilers are currently supported:</p>

<ul>
<li>Compiled into CSS: SASS/Compass, LESS, Stylus.</li>
<li>Compiled into JavaScript: CoffeeScript, Eco.</li>
<li>Compiled into HTML: Jade, HAML, Slim.</li>
</ul>


<p>Internally we're using a plugin-like model, and you can easily add support for additional languages if you're adventurous enough (look at *.lrplugin/Info.plist inside the app bundle). There is no official plugin API yet, however (we need to figure out both technical and App Store policy details).</p>
