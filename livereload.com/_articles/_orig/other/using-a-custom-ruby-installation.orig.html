<p>Currently, LiveReload only understands <code>/usr/bin/ruby</code> and RVM rubies in <code>~/.rvm/rubies/</code>, so there is no way to add a non-RVM Ruby installation directly.</p><p>There is a workaround, though: you can use RVM to ‘mount’ your existing Ruby installations into RVM directories, after which LiveReload will be able to see and use them.</p><p>It works like this:</p><p>1) <a href="http://rvm.io/">Install RVM</a> if you don't already have one.</p><p>2) Use <code>rvm automount</code> command to add (‘mount’) existing Ruby installations from $PATH.</p><p>After that, you'll be able to use your existing rubies in LiveReload.</p>
