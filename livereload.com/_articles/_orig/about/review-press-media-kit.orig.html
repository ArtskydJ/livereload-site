<h2>Promo codes giveaway</h2>

<p>You can get 5-10 promo codes to give away (if you do that kind of stuff). A few ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>publish them on the product review page to reward your loyal readers, or</p></li>
<li><p>post them to your Twitter account over a few days to increase your following, or</p></li>
<li><p>send them to your email subscribers over the next several issues to increase engagement.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Gotchas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Subject to availability â€” I only get 50 promo codes from Apple per each released version.</p></li>
<li><p>The codes expire every few weeks, so it's best to postpone generating the codes until you actually need them. Please contact me to reserve the codes in advance, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Each code can only be used once.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Promo codes are to be redeemed on the Mac App Store using a 'Redeem' link under Quick Links.</p>
