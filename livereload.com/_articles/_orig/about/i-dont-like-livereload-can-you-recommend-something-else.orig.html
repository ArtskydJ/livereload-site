<p>Sure! Depends on why LiveReload isn't suitable for you, though.</p><h2>LiveReload is too expensive for me</h2><p>This one is easy. Just use the unlimited trial version, and optionally open a support request to ask for a free license. I always give free licenses to everyone who asks.</p><h2>I don't like LiveReload, but I still want some native app</h2><p>Fair enough. If you're on a Mac, try <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">Brian Jones' CodeKit app</a> — it is generally regarded as awesome, and people who don't like the UI of LiveReload are probably looking for something like that.</p><p>Also try these ones:</p><p></p><ul style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);  "><li><a href="http://fireapp.handlino.com">Fire.app</a> has a similar functionality and has pretty much no UI except for the menu bar icon. The authors are very nice, and they actually use LiveReload's browser extensions (which are open-source and thus free to reuse).<br></li><li><a href="http://wearekiss.com/simpless">SimpLESS</a> will get your LESS compiled on any platform</li></ul><h2><span style="line-height: 19px;">I'd rather use a command-line tool</span></h2><p><span style="line-height: 19px;">I'm considering a command-line mode for LiveReload 3.x, btw.</span></p><p></p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/guard/guard-livereload">guard-livereload</a> — awesome open-source command-line tool</li>
<li><a href="http://lepture.com/project/livereload/">Python LiveReload server</a> — also has guard-like features</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mockko/livereload">livereload 1.x</a> — the original command-line tool that started it all, now deprecated (because guard-livereload is more popular, and it made zero sense for two open-source command-line tools to compete)</li>
</ul>


<h2>I'd rather use a JavaScript-only solution that's based on polling</h2>

<p>Beware: These ones might be easier to get running, but will eat up your CPU and battery:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://livejs.com/">live.js</a> is a browser script that continuously updates the page in the browser</li>
<li><a href="http://cssrefresh.frebsite.nl/">CSSrefresh</a> seems to be similar to live.js</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dbergey/Reloadr">Reloadr</a> is a tool for PHP that does continuous polling like live.js</li>
</ul>


<h2>Other options</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://nodejuice.com/">nodeJuice</a>&nbsp;is a command-line tool, seems similar to LiveReload, but I haven't heard of it much</li>
</ul>
