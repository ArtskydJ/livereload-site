<p>(As of July 2014.)</p><h2>Version 3.x</h2><p>I've been working on version 3.0, the next major cross-platform release, since summer 2012. It will be a free upgrade, but I have no release date to announce.</p><h2>Version 2.x on the Mac</h2><p>In maintenance mode. Generally works pretty well.</p><h2>Support</h2><p>Support tickets are being replied on time since August 2013. From May 2014, I generally have a one-day response time on all tickets (yay, my life's getting back in order!)</p><p>I had periods when I haven't been attending to support requests from ~November 2012 to ~July 2013. If this has affected you, I'm very sorry; yes, I am. I have 770 unanswered tickets from that period. When I actually became capable of replying, several months have passed by, and it would be very funny to send a response at that point.</p><p>I have improved my support process a lot, and generally resolved the problems that I had.</p><p>A.</p><div></div>
