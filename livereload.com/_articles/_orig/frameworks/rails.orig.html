<p>LiveReload works wonders with any version of Rails.</p>

<p>Rails 3 handles all assets compilation itself (via Sprockets), which means you should NOT enable compilation in LiveReload. Just add your Rails project to LiveReload and boom, you get your live reloading.</p>

<p>If you're using Rails 2 and want LiveReload to handle asset compilation, go ahead and enable it.</p>
