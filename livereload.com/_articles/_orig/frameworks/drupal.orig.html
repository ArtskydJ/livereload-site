<p>LiveReload works wonders with Drupal.</p>

<p>Drupal 6 is compatible with every version of LiveReload.</p>

<p>Drupal 7 requires LiveReload 2.0 β3 or later to handle @import's correctly. Earlier versions of LiveReload need <a href="http://drupal.org/project/livereload" target="_blank">livereload Drupal module</a> to handle @import's correctly (LiveReload 2.0 β3+ does not require that module, and we encourage you to disable/uninstall it).</p>

<p>A feature we have in mind <em>for the future</em> is “live database monitoring”: make changes in your site admin, see the effect immediately. Be sure to let us know if you're interested!</p>
