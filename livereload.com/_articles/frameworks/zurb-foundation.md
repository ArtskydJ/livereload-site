Starting with LiveReload 2.3.15, we have updated ZURB Foundation to version 3\. Which means you are either:

*   using ZURB Foundation 2 (`@import ZURB-foundation`), and running LiveReload 2.3.15 or later; please open a new support ticket and tell us about it;
*   using ZURB Foundation 3 (`@import foundation`), and running an older version of LiveReload; please [download the latest version from our site](http://go.livereload.com/mac).
