      :markdown
        LiveReload monitors changes in the file system. As soon as you save a file, it is [preprocessed as needed](#compilers), and the browser is refreshed.

        Even cooler, when you change a CSS file or an image, the browser is updated instantly without reloading the page.

      :markdown
        The full source code of LiveReload 2 is available on GitHub: [LiveReload2](https://github.com/livereload/LiveReload2) (Mac on master branch, Windows on node branch), [livereload-plugins](https://github.com/livereload/livereload-plugins), [livereload-js](https://github.com/livereload/livereload-js), [livereload-extensions](https://github.com/livereload/livereload-extensions).

        Why? Because curiosity is the most basic and important quality of good developers. I believe that everyone benefits from being able to study and tinker with other people's software.

        There is no formal license attached. You are free to tinker with it and share the results with your friends, but please don't distribute binaries publicly without my permission. I still expect every user to pay for a license, unless you have a good reason not to.

        The browser extensions and livereload.js are under MIT. If you find a nice generic class or a piece of code you'd like to reuse, I will probably be happy to release it under MIT.

        Optional: [Behind the scenes story on this decision, GPL and indie software](http://tarantsov.com/blog/2012/02/the-third-definition-of-open/).

    a(name='getting-started')

      h2 Getting Started, or<br>N things you need to know about LiveReload

      :markdown
        1. LiveReload lives in your menu bar.

        2. It works with Safari, Chrome, Firefox and Mobile Safari. Also Opera if you [enable web sockets](http://techdows.com/2010/12/enable-websockets-in-opera-11.html).

        3. Yes, you heard that right, LiveReload <3 iPhones, iPads and their Simulators if you [insert a JavaScript snippet](http://go.livereload.com/integration).

        4. If adding a tag is not your thing, and you're only interested in desktop browsers, only on your computer, [use our browser extensions](http://go.livereload.com/extensions).

        5. VMs or testing from other PCs? Same as with mobile devices, really; the JavaScript snippet is your friend. (It is displayed in the LiveReload window, btw, so you can't possibly miss it.)

        6. How do you stop that snippet from making it into production, then? Well, simple: add an IF and check location.host, and then feel free to commit and deploy.

        7. What happens if there's a hideous error in your shiny CoffeeScript or SASS file? LiveReload will display an error notification. It will also detect which editor you are using and display a corresponding “Edit in Submate Wrangler” button.

        8. That edit button goes to great lengths to jump to the exact error location. One would expect any text editor since sed to be able to jump to a specific line number from the command line. Alas, guys like Coda and Espresso make it hard (as in, emulate-command-L-typing-a-number-pressing-enter hard), which works just as well as it sounds.

        9. Back to basics. It is important to know that LiveReload only monitors files with specific extensions. A nice fat list is hard-coded, but you can add your own ones in monitoring settings.

        1. LiveReload has been tested with [Rails](http://go.livereload.com/using/with/rails), [Drupal](http://go.livereload.com/using/with/drupal), [WordPress](http://go.livereload.com/using/with/wordpress), [Joomla](http://go.livereload.com/using/with/joomla) and [ExpessionEngine](http://go.livereload.com/using/with/ee), all of which are links to articles with useful framework-specific information.

        1. Working with file: protocol? @import quirks? Keyboard shortcuts? Explore our [knowledge base](http://go.livereload.com/kb) to find out more.

        1. If you are ever stuck, there's a nice friendly question mark button in the title bar. Think of it as a modern version of DON'T PANIC.

      h2 Compilers

      :markdown
        If you are using stuff like CoffeeScript, SASS or LESS (and you should!), LiveReload will compile them for you all right. Just turn it on; LiveReload is controlled by two main checkboxes, so you won't get lost.

        LiveReload ships with the following compilers: LESS, SASS, Compass, Stylus, CoffeeScript, IcedCoffeeScript, Eco, SLIM, HAML, Jade.

        If you're using any of the following compilers, please read additional details on our knowledge base:

        * [More about SASS and Compass support](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86203-sass-compass)

        * [More about LESS support](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86170-less).


  section.plugins-section
    a(name='plugins')
    .left
      h2 Plugins

      :markdown
        The compilers supported by LiveReload aren't set in stone; they are provided by bundled plugins, and you can add your own ones too. (We even look for them in Dropbox/Library, to save you some trouble if you're using Dropbox and multiple Macs.)

        No coding is invoked: write a JSON manifest, copy required files and there you go. You can find all the docs you need in [livereload-plugins](https://github.com/livereload/livereload-plugins) repository.


  section.postprocessing-section
    a(name='postprocessing')
    .left
      h2 Post-processing

      :markdown
        LiveReload can invoke a Terminal command after processing changes. Run a Rake/Cake task, a Shell script or anything else you need.

        Protip: If you're working with some Ruby stuff and want to use RVM, pick the correct Ruby interpreter in compilation options (which also affect post-processing).

      h2 Acknowledgements

      :markdown
        LiveReload has been inspired by XRefresh, an old Firebug plugin made by our friends at BinaryAge. Their [TotalFinder](http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/) product is awesome, and you might find [FireQuery](http://firequery.binaryage.com/) and [other free tools](http://www.binaryage.com/) useful too.
